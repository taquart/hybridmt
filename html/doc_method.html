%% Theoretical background
%% Moment tensor inversion
% The moment tensor inversion in |focimt| is a well-known procedure that relies 
% on optimizing the following inverse problem:
%
% $$U=GM$$
%
% where $G$ is the |n-by-6| matrix containing Green’s function derivatives, $U$ 
% is |n-by-1| matrix of ground displacements observed, M is |1-by-6| matrix 
% containing six independent moment tensor components, and $n$ is the number of 
% ground displacement observations. As the above system of equations is 
% overdetermined (it has more observations than unknowns), it is typically 
% solved using the least-squares approach (L2 norm) with the cost function 
% being the sum of squares of residuals. In addition, |focimt| allows to use the 
% absolute (L1) norm which is less sensitive to larger errors at the cost of 
% significantly increased computation time.
%
% Regardless of the norm used to optimize the equation above, the seismic moment tensor inversion 
% is performed systematically in three different ways assuming unconstrained, 
% as well as constrained deviatoric and double-couple moment tensors. 
% The deviatoric moment tensor solution is obtained by assuming no volumetric 
% change in the resolved moment tensor (i.e. the trace of the resolved moment tensor 
% is equal to zero) during linear inversion. The double-couple constrained moment 
% tensor is resolved by further imposing the determinant of the seismic moment 
% tensor to be zero as well. The latter constraint makes the moment tensor 
% inversion scheme non-linear and the Lagrange multipliers method 
% (Oncescu, 1986) is used to determine the double-couple constrained moment 
% tensor.

%%%
% *Uncertainty assessment*
%%%
% Uncertainties of the estimated moment tensors can be estimated through 
% the normalized root-mean-square (RMS) error between theoretical and estimated 
% amplitudes (Stierle et al., 2014a, 2014b) following the formula:
%
% $$RMS=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(U_i^{measured}-U_i^{th})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N(U_i^{measured})^2}}$$
%
% The application is capable to produce additional solutions calculated from
% resampled datasets. The number of phases, polarity, the amplitude as well as the
% takeoff angle may be randomply perturbed and the resampled input phase 
% data will be used to calculate additional momente tensor solution. Having the
% multiple moment tensor solutions from numerous resamplings of input data, 
% it is possible to calculate the probability density functions of obtained
% moment tensor characteristics to characterize their uncertainties.

% ground displacement amplitudes using the following scheme:
%
% $$u_{ij}^{*,obs} = u_{ij}^{obs} + w_i u_{ij}^{obs}(r_i - 1) $$
%
% where $w_i$ is the weighting factor for each station. The updated ground 
% displacement data are used to calculate a new set of seismic moment
