I. Compilation

1. Program requires CAIRO library to compile. It is likely you have this library
   already installed. If this is not the case, the development package can
   be downloaded from https://cairographics.org/.
   Following the guidlines located in https://cairographics.org/download/, it's
   enough to open the terminal and execute:
   
   For Debian (including Ubuntu):
   
     sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
   
   For Fedora:
   
     sudo yum install cairo-devel
   
   For openSUSE:
   
     zypper install cairo-devel   
    
2. Enter the focimt-x.x.x and execute command 'make'. 
3. If everything goes well, the 'focimt' binary should be created in the above
   folder. Just copy the newly created file to the directory where focimt.m 
   exists. If you are in the folder focimt-x.x.x, you can just type:
   
     mv focimt ../..
   
II. Troubleshooting

   Calling compiled focimt binary by focimt.m in MATLAB sometimes results in 
   a weird MATLAB error with the following message which looks similar to this:
   
     'MATLAB error: libstdc++.so: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15′ not found'
   
   The reason for this error is described in details in the article posted
   here (Credits to Robert0812 for solution!):

   To make the long story short, MATLAB searches the dynamic libraries firstly 
   within its own library path which is located at 
   /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a/bin/glnxa64/ or 
   /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a/sys/os/glnxa64 and then it searches through the 
   system library path. 
   
   The build-in library of MATLAB is somehow (reads: ALWAYS - G.K.) slightly 
   out-of-date, and the version GLIBCXX_3.4.15 simply doesn’t exist in the 
   old library. 
   
   The simple solution is to link the current version of libstdc++ library 
   (with which the focimt was just compiled) with an 'old' library file 
   using simple command:
   
     sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.16 /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012a/bin/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6
   
   (please note the locations of directories may be slightly different, but 
   you should be able to figure out how it works).
